# 🧾 EduProof – On-Chain Certificate Verification

EduProof is a simple **Solidity smart contract** that allows educational institutions to **store and verify student certificates on the blockchain**.  
It ensures **authenticity**, **transparency**, and **tamper-proof storage** of academic records.  

---

## 🎯 Project Description

Traditional certificates can be lost, forged, or manipulated.  
EduProof solves this by keeping all verified certificates directly **on-chain** —  
making them easily **verifiable** and **immutable**.

Institutions can issue certificates, and anyone can later verify them using a unique Certificate ID.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Lets the contract **owner (institution)** issue certificates with student details.  
- Stores information such as student name, course name, institution, and issue date.  
- Enables **public verification** of certificates anytime, from anywhere.  
- Allows the owner to **revoke** a certificate if it becomes invalid.
